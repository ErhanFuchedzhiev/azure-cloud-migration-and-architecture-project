# Networking Overview

## What Has Been Implemented

This document summarizes the complete networking setup for the Azure VM migration case study.  
It outlines the implemented components, their configurations, and validation status.

| Component | Description | Status |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| **Virtual Network (VNet)** | Custom VNet with private address space (`10.0.0.0/16`). | ✅ |
| **Subnet** | Default subnet configured (`10.0.0.0/24`). | ✅ |
| **Network Security Group (NSG)** | `vm-nsg` created to control inbound/outbound traffic. | ✅ |
| **Inbound Rule (RDP)** | TCP/3389 allowed *only from my public IP* for secure admin access. | ✅ |
| **NIC Association** | NSG associated with VM NIC (`vm-cli-nic`). | ✅ |
| **Verification** | Verified effective rules using `az network nic list-effective-nsg`. | ✅ |

This implementation establishes a **secure, verified network baseline** for a single VM, suitable for migration, testing, and validation activities.
