# azure-vm-migration-case-study
This project is a hands-on Azure VM Migration Case Study that shows how to move a virtual machine from an on-premises setup to Microsoft Azure.

It walks through every step of building a secure and reliable environment in the cloud — from creating a Virtual Network (VNet) and Network Security Group (NSG) to setting up RDP access, linking the NSG to a VM network interface, and verifying everything with the Azure CLI.

Each stage includes clear documentation, example scripts, and screenshots to make it easy to follow along or recreate on your own Azure account.

Here’s what’s covered in this case study:

Virtual Network & Subnet – Custom network setup for private addressing.

NSG & Firewall Rules – Manage inbound and outbound traffic securely.

RDP Access – Only my public IP is allowed for remote desktop login.

NIC Association – Attach the NSG to your VM’s network interface.

Validation – Confirm the setup using Azure CLI and portal tools.

The goal of this project is to give a simple, real-world example of how to design and secure a virtual machine in Azure. It’s built to help learners and IT professionals understand how networking, security, and automation work together in the cloud.

By the end, you’ll have a clear view of how a small Azure environment is created, protected, and verified — just like in a real migration project.
