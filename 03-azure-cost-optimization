# Azure Cost Optimization Design

## Objective
This document outlines **cost optimization strategies** applied in the Azure Virtual Machine migration case study.  
It explains how each architectural choice reduces operational cost while maintaining availability and performance — key principles of the **AZ-305: Design for Cost Optimization** domain.

---

## 1. Resource Group & Region Selection
| Decision | Optimization Rationale |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Region:** East US 2 | Selected for low cost per vCPU and storage, while still offering multi-zone availability. |
| **Resource Group:** `vm-cli-rg` | Logical isolation of related resources allows easier cleanup (single delete) to stop billing when not needed. |

> *Always deploy related components in the same region to avoid cross-region data transfer costs.*

---

## ⚙️ 2. VM Sizing and Type
| Setting | Value | Optimization Strategy |
|----------|--------|-----------------------|
| **VM Size** | `Standard_B1s` | Uses burstable CPU model — ideal for test and dev workloads. Pay for baseline, burst when needed. |
| **OS Image** | Windows Server 2022 Datacenter (Gen2) | Eligible for Azure Hybrid Benefit (reuse existing licenses). |
| **Disk Type** | Standard SSD (LRS) | Balanced performance and cost for general-purpose workloads. |

> *For non-production workloads, use B-series or Spot VMs to save up to 80%.*

---

## 3. Scheduling & Auto-Shutdown
The **Auto-shutdown feature** was enabled in the Management tab:

| Setting | Value |
|----------|--------|
| **Auto-shutdown time** | 19:00 UTC |
| **Notifications enabled** | Yes |

> Automatically shutting down low-usage VMs prevents unnecessary billing during off-peak hours.

CLI Example:
```bash
az vm auto-shutdown --resource-group vm-cli-rg --name vm-cli-01 --time 1900

## 4. Monitoring & Cost Visibility
To ensure ongoing cost governance:

- **Azure Cost Management + Advisor:** Track daily and monthly cost trends.
- **Budgets & Alerts:** Configure spending thresholds for the resource group `vm-cli-rg`.
- **Azure Advisor Recommendations:** Enable performance and cost recommendations directly from the portal.

*These insights help continuously adjust sizing, redundancy, and schedules for optimal cost efficiency.*
