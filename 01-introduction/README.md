# Module 1: Introduction to Azure Virtual Machines

This module introduces the concept of **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)** and how they can help organizations migrate to the cloud and scale their infrastructure.

In this case study, a global medical research company is facing challenges with aging on-premises servers, global distribution, and rapidly growing data workloads. Transitioning to Azure Virtual Machines provides flexibility, scalability, and simplified management, enabling the organization to improve performance and operational efficiency.
