## Pre-Creation Checklist (UK Case Study)

Before deploying Azure Virtual Machines for the medical research company in England, it’s essential to plan carefully to ensure scalability, data compliance, and operational efficiency.  
The following checklist outlines key considerations before creating VMs in Azure:

- **Workload characteristics:** OS type (Windows/Linux), version, dependencies  
- **VM size:** CPU, memory, and storage requirements based on application workloads  
- **Region and availability:** select a UK-based Azure region (such as *UK South* or *UK West*) to meet data residency and compliance requirements  
- **Networking:** virtual network configuration, subnet design, IP addressing, and Network Security Groups (NSGs)  
- **Storage:** OS disk type (Standard or Premium SSD), data disks, and required IOPS performance  
- **Security & identity:** role-based access control (RBAC), patching, and backup strategies aligned with UK data protection standards  
- **Management:** use Azure Monitor, Update Management, and VM extensions for ongoing performance and security oversight  
- **Migration path:** plan the migration from on-premises to Azure, including test environments and a structured cut-over strategy

### Practical Example

In this case study, the IT team plans to migrate database and analytics workloads from regional data centres across England to Microsoft Azure.  
Using this checklist, they determined that **D-series VMs** provide the right balance between performance and cost for their analytical workloads.  
They selected the **UK South** region to ensure data residency compliance and configured **Premium SSD storage** to improve query performance and reliability for their research datasets.  

This planning phase ensures that the migration to Azure aligns with the company’s compliance requirements and performance goals, providing a strong foundation for VM deployment.
