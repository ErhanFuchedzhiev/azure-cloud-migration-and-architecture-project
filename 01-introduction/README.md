# Module 1: Azure Infrastructure, Migration, and Architecture Design

## 1.In this project, I design and implement a complete Azure cloud architecture for a global medical research company that is migrating from on-premises infrastructure to Microsoft Azure.
My goal is to demonstrate how I approach real-world cloud architecture â€” from planning and governance to migration, cost optimization, security, and automation.
Through this case study, I showcase my ability to design, build, and document end-to-end Azure solutions using industry best practices and multiple tools, including Azure CLI, PowerShell, Bash, Bicep, and Python.


## 2.Project Scope and Structure

This project covers the entire lifecycle of designing and migrating an environment into Azure:

1.Plan and Create Virtual Machines
I planned the migration of on-premises servers and created Azure Virtual Machines configured for secure remote access, availability, and performance.

2.Azure Cost Optimization
I optimized VM sizing, applied Azure Hybrid Benefit, enabled auto-shutdown, and implemented budget and alert policies to control spend.

3.Networking Overview
I built a network design with Virtual Networks (VNets), subnets, and Network Security Groups (NSGs) that restrict access to trusted sources. I verified security using effective NSG rules and automation scripts.

4.Identity, Governance, and Monitoring
I enforced access control through RBAC, Azure Policy, and resource tagging. I integrated Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Defender for Cloud to centralize monitoring and strengthen security posture.

5.Data Platform, Integration, and Application Services
I deployed a SQL Server instance, implemented backup and recovery, and experimented with event-driven integration using Azure Event Grid. I also containerized selected components using Docker for modularity and scalability.

6.Automation and Scripting
I automated many configuration steps with PowerShell, Azure CLI, Bash, and Bicep templates, ensuring my environment could be rebuilt quickly and reliably.
