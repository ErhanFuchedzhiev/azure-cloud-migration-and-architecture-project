# azure-vm-migration-case-study
Case study demonstrating the migration of an on-premises infrastructure to Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.

This project includes hands-on implementation of key Azure components — such as virtual networks, NSGs, backups, and VM deployment automation — along with detailed CLI scripts and documentation.

It serves as a structured, real-world example of cloud adoption, security configuration, and cost optimization for enterprise-grade environments.
