# 06 - Data Platform, Integration, and Application Overview

## Purpose
This section demonstrates how the migrated Azure environment evolves beyond virtual machines — into a **modern data, integration, and application platform**.  
It covers **containers**, **managed databases**, **event-driven messaging**, and the **application hosting layer**, showing how each component contributes to scalability, modernization, observability, and hybrid connectivity.

---

## Architecture Vision

The data platform, integration, and application layer enable:
- **Scalable compute** using containerization or App Service (Azure Container Instances / AKS / Web App for Linux)
- **Managed persistence** through Azure Database for PostgreSQL (private endpoint + Key Vault)
- **Decoupled data flow** with Event Grid–based messaging and hybrid connectivity
- **Application observability** through Application Insights and Azure Monitor
- **Governed access** with security and networking consistency across all layers

These components together form the **foundation for modernization** — enabling services and applications to communicate asynchronously and securely across hybrid or cloud-only deployments.

## Subtopics in this Section

| Topic | Description | Example Azure Services | Reference |
|-------|--------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Containers** | Deploy modern applications or microservices as containers. Demonstrates scalability and isolation beyond IaaS VMs. | Azure Container Instances, Azure Kubernetes Service | [10-containerization-and-PaaS-deployment.md](10-containerization-and-PaaS-deployment.md) |
| **Databases** | Implement managed data storage with network isolation, secrets management, and encryption. | Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Key Vault | [11-create-secure-postgres-with-private-endpoint-and-keyvault-injection.md](11-create-secure-postgres-with-private-endpoint-and-keyvault-injection.md) |
| **Integration** | Enable data and event flow between systems, decouple workloads, and demonstrate hybrid connectivity. | Azure Event Grid, Storage Account (optional) | [12-integration-eventing-messaging.md](12-integration-eventing-messaging.md) |
| **Application** | Host and monitor modern workloads post-migration. Use App Service or container platforms integrated with Key Vault and Application Insights for secure runtime and observability. | Azure App Service, Managed Identity, Application Insights | [10-containerization-and-PaaS-deployment.md](10-containerization-and-PaaS-deployment.md) |

## Data Platform and Application Design Highlights

- **Hybrid Connectivity:** All data and services use private networking or secured endpoints.  
- **Decoupled Communication:** Event Grid ensures event-driven integration between workloads.  
- **Governed Access:** Key Vault and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) secure sensitive data.  
- **Application Observability:** Application Insights integrates with App Service and container workloads for telemetry, tracing, and proactive monitoring.  
- **End-to-End Modernization:** Combines compute, data, and integration layers to deliver a fully managed, event-driven application environment.
