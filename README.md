# Azure Cloud Migration and Architecture Project

In this project, I design and implement a complete Azure environment for a global medical research company migrating from on-premises infrastructure to Microsoft Azure.  
My goal is to demonstrate how I approach real-world Azure architecture — covering planning, cost optimization, networking, identity governance, data platform integration, automation, and monitoring.

Each stage includes detailed documentation, example scripts, and diagrams to make it easy to understand or reproduce in your own Azure subscription.

## What This Project Covers

- **Virtual Machines** – Migration of on-premises workloads into Azure VMs  
- **Networking** – Custom VNets, subnets, and Network Security Groups (NSGs)  
- **Identity & Governance** – RBAC, Azure Policy, tagging, and compliance  
- **Cost Optimization** – VM right-sizing, auto-shutdown, budgets, and alerts  
- **Data Platform** – SQL Server setup, backups, and Docker containers  
- **Automation** – PowerShell, Bash, Azure CLI, Bicep, and Python scripting  
- **Monitoring & Security** – Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Defender for Cloud

## Project Goal

My objective is to demonstrate how I plan, build, and document an end-to-end **Azure migration and architecture** that is secure, automated, and cost-efficient.  
This project reflects my approach as an **Azure Solutions Architect**, focusing on design principles, governance, and operational excellence.

## Outcome

By following this project, you’ll see how I create a complete, production-ready Azure environment that integrates infrastructure, security, automation, and data services — just like in a real enterprise migration.
